# Endosymbiosis
This is a demo game showcasing features and power of the Crynon game engine
In Endosymbiosis you learn about how cells were created billions of years ago.

## How to play

First, how Endosymbiosis even works. When cells "eat" other bacteria which don't get destroyed, they might start working together.
Your mission is to feed cells bacteria that they can use to defend against natural causes. Every saved cell gives you a point to your score.

- Mouse or right thumstick to look around
- Left click or left trigger to shoot
- A/D, left/right arrows or controller shoulders to change selected bacteria
- ESC to toggle cursor mode.
